A Task Manager application created in React as the client-side and Django Rest Framework as the server-side

React in a nutshell, is a JavaScript library that is great for developing single page applications (SPA) and it has solid documentation if you're interested tor read about React.

And I have a react tutorial video where I explained how React works and how we can connect it to Django in order to send requests from the client to the server and return responses to the client.

So React serves as the front-end , handling UI through the requests to Django's backend.

## PREREQUISITES :
